        v3.1. Look at table 32 for current consumption numbers for System On (I_ON) and
        System Off (I_OFF). Table 36 shows current consumed by the radio peripheral for
        LDO mode. For example, I_TX,0dBm is the current consumption used when radio TX
        is enabled with 0dBm transmit power. I_RX,1M is the current consumption when
        radio RX is enabled for BLE or ANT. Table 37 then shows the same numbers when
        DCDC mode is enabled. LDO mode and DCDC modes are explained later in this post.</p>

to find out how to set up the kit in order to measure current. In addition to
the text in the user guide, make sure you power-reset the nRF51 after flashing
your firmware to it. After flashing, the nRF51 stays in debugger-mode, which
consumes excessive current (~1mA). When the nRF51 is power-reset, it will enter
normal-mode where actual current consumption can be measured. It is also
possible to use nrfjprog.exe (part of nrf Tools) with the command "nrfjprog
--pinreset" in order to enter normal mode.</p>
    <p>To test current consumption for the nRF51 low power modes without softdevice,

        <a
            href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/blogs/782/bluetooth-smart-and-the-nordics-softdevices-part-1/">advertising packets</a>
        or connection packets in so called BLE advertising/connection events. Between
        BLE advertising/connection events, the nRF51 should be in System On low power
        mode and should consume ~4uA. It is however hard to see the current consumption
        between those events on a multimeter if the advertising/connection interval (the
        time between advertising/connection events) is small. If you modify the
        application to have long advertising interval, the reading on your multimeter
        should stabilize between advertising events, and you should be able to read the
        expected ~4uA. The advertising interval can be adjusted from 20ms to 10.24s, and
        can be set to e.g. 4 seconds in the power profiling example by modifying the
        following define at the top of the main.c file:</p>
    <div
        class="content-scrollable-wrapper"

        <pre><code>#define APP_CFG_CONNECTION_INTERVAL   4000
</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>To test the power profiling application, press Button 1 on the nRF51-DK
        (PCA10028) in order start the advertising after you upload the code to the
        nRF51-DK board and power-reset it. Note that when connection is established, the
        connection interval is determined by the central device which is normally
        relatively short. Since the power profiling application does not send connection
        parameter update request to the central, the connection interval stays short and
        current consumption is therefore relatively high when connected.</p>

        <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>
        <br>
            nRF51 consumes excessive current after entering either System On low power mode
            or System Off mode, the most likely reasons for that are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The nRF51 is in debug mode. Solution: Power reset the chip in order to enter
                normal mode.</li>
            <li>The nRF51 remains in debug mode after power reset on custom board. Solution:
                connect an external resistor to SWDCLK pin as described on
                <a
                    href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/17282/nrf51822-swdioswdclk-internal-pull-resistors/">this thread</a>
            </li>
            <li>There is a leakage current on GPIO or SWD pins. Solution: Disconnect
                everything from debug interface and GPIO pins. To disconnect the debug interface
                on PCA10001 boards set the SW4 switch on your PCA10001 board to OFF</li>
            <li>You have configured GPIO pin as input with no pull. For solution, see answer on
                <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/21598/system-power-off/">this thread</a>
            </li>
            <li>You are using evaluation kit or development kit and LEDs are connected on
                your board. Solution: Disconnect the LEDs or disable them in software. When
                using nRF51-DK or nRF51-Dongle, LEDs are not included in the current
                measurement.</li>
            <li>You have enabled a peripheral before entering System On low power mode.
                Solution: Disable the peripheral in question before entering System On mode. For
                System Off mode this is not needed as all peripherals are powered off in System
                Off mode.</li>
            <li>You have explicitly enabled "Constant Latency mode". Solution: Enter low
                power mode before entering System On low power mode with
                NRF_POWER-&gt;TASKS_LOWPWR = 1;</li>

            <strong>Choice of 32 kHz clock source</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Also, in your design you should consider what low frequency clock source to
            use. As the nRF51 reference manual states there is a choice of three low
            frequency clock sources, external crystal, internal RC and the synthesized
            clock. Using the synthesized clock is of really no use in terms of current
            consumption since it will require the 16 MHz clock to be constantly enabled.
            Using a high accuracy external crystal is clearly the best choice in terms of
            current consumption.</p>
        <p>Another choice is to use the internal 32kHz RC oscillator and calibrate every
            4 seconds to maintain accuracy within 250 ppm. A motivation for using the
            internal 32kHz RC is either to decrease BOM or to save space on PCB. Using
            internal low frequency 32kHz RC clock instead of 20ppm external crystal will add
            around 10 uA current consumption compared to 20ppm external crystal. The
            internal 32kHz RC needs to be calibrated every 4 seconds and obtains frequency
            tolerance of 250ppm.</p>
        <p>When initialising the softdevice with ble_stack_init() function call in the
            main function, select the NRF_CLOCK_LFCLKSRC_RC_250_PPM_TEMP_4000MS_CALIBRATION
            option when using the internal RC clock. For further information on choice of
            32kHz clock source with a softdevice, look at

        <h2>
            <strong>Choice of 16 MHz external crystal</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>To minimize current consumption, choose 16MHz external crystal with minimal
            “startup” current consumption. For this purpose you should choose a crystal with
            low load capacitance, i.e. around 9 pF instead of the specified maximum of 16 pF
            for the nRF51.</p>

            <strong>Use of timers</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>If using BLE, use the application timers that are generally used in the BLE
            examples in the SDK. Those use the RTC1 in the background which is very power
            efficient. Look at i.e. the ble_app_hrs example which has several application
            timers implemented.</p>
        <h2>
            <strong>Low power mode with BLE softdevice</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Most BLE examples in the SDK will include the power_manage call in the main
            function. This call uses the
            <a
                href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF51_SDK/nRF51_SDK_v8.x.x/doc/8.0.0/s110/html/a01073.html#ga11d88d38ac99fb72cde74c9385d36433">sd_app_event_wait()</a>
            softdevice call (or power_manage()) which enables the System On low power mode,
            which keeps current consumption to a minimum.</p>
        <p>To put a device into System Off mode when using the softdevice, call
            <a
                href="http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF51_SDK/doc/7.2.0/s110/html/a01075.html#ga774947ee0e200456ea3aec3fc7f8bd6b">sd_power_system_off()</a>
            function.</p>
        <p>The softdevice uses RTC0 to keep track of time and to know when to wake up
            for the next BLE connection event. The RTC0 will eventually wake the chip up and
            the softdevice will carry out the action needed for the BLE connection event,
            which includes receiving and sending packages. When it is done, execution will
            continue where it left off in the application after sd_app_event_wait() command.
            Normally in BLE examples in the SDK, the sd_app_event_wait() command is inside
            the main loop, therefore code residing in the main loop will execute once and
            then the sd_app_event_wait() is called again and the chip will sleep again in
            System On low power mode until the next BLE connection event.</p>
        <p>What sd_app_event_wait() actually does is to disable the CPU. All peripherals
            (e.g. SPI, UART, TIMER, ...) that are enabled before calling sd_app_event_wait()
            will still be enabled. The CPU will actually wake up on any interrupt, i.e. it
            will wake up for BLE connection/advertising events, softdevice callbacks or
            peripheral interrupts (e.g. SPI, UART, TIMER, ... interrupts).</p>
        <h2>
            <strong>Tuning connection parameters</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Control of current consupmtion during connection is mainly a question of
            tuning the Bluetooth connection parameters. If your "connection interval"
            parameter is large, communication will be slow and your device will consume
            little current during connection and packet delay will be relatively large.
            Setting short connection interval will enable larger throughput and relatively
            short packet delay but your device will consume more current. "Slave latency" is
            another bluetooth parameter that allows the device to not respond to number of
            packets sent from the host. This will decrease current consumption of the device
            while still allowing data bursts with high thoroughput.</p>
        <p>A typical scenario for transmitting data on a button press is to have BLE
            connection with relatively low connection interval but with high slave latency.
            Low connection interval will enable your device to send packets frequently, i.e.
            to have a good response on a button press. High slave latency will allow your
            device to not send packets on every connection event, thereby saving current.</p>
        <p>“Slave latency” is a special BLE connection parameter. Information about the
            slave latency parameter is found on the
            <a
                href="http://developer.bluetooth.org/DevelopmentResources/Pages/BLE-Optimizations.asp">Bluetooth Developer site</a>, A quote from this site about slave latency:</p>
        <p>
            <em>
                <strong>Slave Latency</strong>
                – Slave latency allows a slave to use a reduced number of connection events. The
                connSlaveLatency parameter defines the number of consecutive connection events
                that the slave device is not required to listen for the master. As a result,
                slave device can skip a number of connection events if it does not have
                additional data resulting in power savings.</em>
        </p>
        <p>For example, for an energy sensitive application, you choose relatively long
            connection interval, e.g. 4 seconds, in order to save energy of the peripheral.
            This will make the host/master send a packet every 4 seconds, also requesting
            the slave/peripheral to respond with a packet transmission (to tell the master
            that the slave is alive, which prevents link loss) which will also contain data
            if the slave/peripheral has some data to send. An alternative would be to create
            a connection interval of 1 second and have a slave latency of 3. This would make
            the master send packets to the slave every second but the slave would be
            obligated to respond only to every fourth packet. This will therefore not create
            an increase in current consumption for the slave compared to the 4 second
            connection interval, but instead will decrease slave data delay and enable data
            bursts as well from the slave with higher throughput.</p>

#define MAX_CONN_INTERVAL                    MSEC_TO_UNITS(1000, UNIT_1_25_MS)          /**&lt; Maximum acceptable connection interval (1 second). */
</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>which means that the connection interval will be 0.5-1.0 seconds, but it is
            really up to the central device to set the connection interval. More information

            <strong>Tuning Advertising parameters</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Current consumption during advertising mainly depends on the advertising
            interval, which is adjusted by modifying the following constant:</p>
        <div
            class="content-scrollable-wrapper content-scrollable-wrapper-scrolled"
            style="max-width: 100%; overflow: auto; max-height: 413.6px;">
            <pre><code>#define APP_ADV_INTERVAL                     40                                         /**&lt; The advertising interval (in units of 0.625 ms. This value corresponds to 25 ms). */
</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>The longer the advertising interval the less current will the device consume
            during advertising. However, when connecting to a central device, increasing the
            advertising interval will normally not decrease current consumption as it will
            take longer for the central device to discover the peripheral device. The result
            is that current consumption will be lower for the peripheral during advertising,
            but it will normally have to advertise for a longer time, therefore, energy
            consumed before connecting to the central will generally be more or less the
            same as when short advertising interval is chosen.</p>
        <p>For some scenarios, it is convenient to advertise periodically, and that will
            save current instead of having the device advertise continuously. The timeout
            for the advertising can be adjusted by modifying the following parameter:</p>
        <div
            class="content-scrollable-wrapper content-scrollable-wrapper-scrolled"
            style="max-width: 100%; overflow: auto; max-height: 413.6px;">
            <pre><code>#define APP_ADV_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS           180                                        /**&lt; The advertising timeout in units of seconds. */
</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>Another parameter that effects the current consumption during advertising is
            how many payload bytes are sent in each advertising packet. It is e.g. typically
            20%-25% lower current consumption during advertising if 10 payload bytes are
            sent in each advertising packet than the maximum of 31 bytes. Therefore, it may
            be beneficial in terms of current consumption to only place primary advertising
            data in the advertising packet and place all secondary data in the scan response
            packet, as advertising packets are sent much more frequently than scan response
            packets.</p>

        <p>The specified current consumption is 0.6uA for System Off mode and no RAM
            retention but if you operate it it low voltage mode it is 1.6uA, refering to
            note 1 in table 27 in the PS v2.0. So. If you intend to use external switching
            regulator you could possibly save some current in low voltage mode for the
            reason that it accepts supply power down to 1.75V, but then you have 1uA higher
            current consumption in both System On and System Off modes. Since you can run
            the LDO mode almost as low, or down to 1.80V, I would assume that choosing the

            <strong>Setup of SPI, UART, TWI interfaces</strong>

        <p>Since the SPI, UART and TWI more or less have the same current consumption
            for different transmission speeds (see nRF51822 PS, “Electrical Specifications”
            chapter) it is most energy efficient to choose maximum transmission speed. This

            current. Disabling a peripheral is usually done by writing a Disabled value to
            the peripheral's ENABLE register, and will ensure that they don't keep the clock
            running when it isn't actually needed. More general information for
            enabling/disabling peripherals is given on

        <p>
            <strong>Low Power UART</strong>
            When you enable the UART on the nRF51822, it will consume a lot of current, ~1mA
            constantly. The strategy is to only enable the UART when data transmission is
            needed. There are primarily two methods for achieving this, one is to manually
            configure two GPIO's for controlling this, second method is to enable the UART
            in LOW_POWER mode, an UART example with low power mode is available on
            <a href="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf51-UART-examples">Nordic's Github</a>. The LOW_POWER mode is implemented in nRF51 SDK 9.0.0 and older SDKs.</p>
        <p>The LOW POWER example will have flow control enabled in a specific LOW POWER
            mode where the nRF51822 is woken up and UART is enabled when CTS goes low.
            nRF51822 will set RTS low when it is ready to receive data. So the peer UART
            device must set nRF51822 CTS low when sending data to nRF51822 and set it high
            again when finished transmitting data. Further information on the functionality
            is given in the Readme for the
            <a href="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf51-UART-examples">UART Low Power example</a>.</p>
        <p>To Enable the UART, both RX and TX, execute the following code:</p>
        <div
            class="content-scrollable-wrapper"
            style="max-width: 100%; overflow: auto; max-height: none;">

NRF_UART0-&gt;TASKS_STARTTX = 1;
NRF_UART0-&gt;TASKS_STARTRX = 1;
</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>If you only need to receive data, enable the UART and only start RX, it will
            consume less current than starting both TX and RX. Similarly, if you only need
            to transmit data, enable the UART and only start TX.</p>
        <p>To disable the UART, execute the following code:</p>
        <div
            class="content-scrollable-wrapper"
            style="max-width: 100%; overflow: auto; max-height: none;">

        <p>
            <strong>Low Power SPI master</strong>
            Similar to the UART, the SPI is high current when enabled. To enable low current
            consumption, you should therefore only enable the SPI when there is data to be
            transmitted.</p>
        <p>To enable the SPI peripheral 0, execute the following code:</p>
        <div
            class="content-scrollable-wrapper"
            style="max-width: 100%; overflow: auto; max-height: none;">
            <pre><code>NRF_SPI0-&gt;ENABLE = 1;

        <p>To disable the SPI peripheral 0, execute the following code:</p>
        <div
            class="content-scrollable-wrapper"
            style="max-width: 100%; overflow: auto; max-height: none;">

        <p>
            <strong>Low Power SPI slave</strong>
            The SPI slave peripheral is low power by default, meaning it consumes close to
            no current when the CSN line is high (chip select for the nRF51 is not set by
            the connected SPI master device). When the CSN line is set low by the SPI
            master, the SPI slave is enabled and consumes ~1mA. The SPI slave goes back into
            low power state when the SPI master ends the SPI transaction by setting the CSN
            line high.</p>
